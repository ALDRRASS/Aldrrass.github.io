                    <p>Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Just my luck, no ice. Life finds a way. Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists. Just my luck, no ice. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?</p>
                    <p>Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? Must go faster. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. You really think you can fly that thing? I was part of something special. Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine? You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck.</p>

I was part of something special. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Checkmate... Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Yes, Yes, without the oops! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don’t eat the tourists.</p>
                    <p>This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager? Must go faster. We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
